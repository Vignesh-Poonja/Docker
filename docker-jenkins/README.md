# Pushing a Docker Image to Docker Hub

This guide explains how to push a custom Jenkins Docker image (`custom-jenkins-latest-with-docker-and-git`) to Docker Hub.

## Steps to Push an Image to Docker Hub

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Log in to Docker Hub
Before pushing an image, log in to your Docker Hub account:
```sh
docker login -u "your_username"
```

If using AWS EC2 and need a non-interactive login:
```sh
echo "your_password" | docker login -u "your_username" --password-stdin
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tag the Docker Image
Docker Hub requires images to have a **namespace** (your Docker Hub username or organization). Tag the image accordingly:
```sh
docker tag custom-jenkins-latest-with-docker-and-git your-dockerhub-username/jenkins-latest:<tag>
```

For example:
```sh
docker tag custom-jenkins-latest-with-docker-and-git vk62/jenkins-latest:v1
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Push the Image to Docker Hub
After tagging, push the image:
```sh
docker push your-dockerhub-username/jenkins-latest:<tag>
```

Example:
```sh
docker push vk62/jenkins-latest:v1
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the Image on Docker Hub
1. Log in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
2. Navigate to **Repositories**
3. You should see the `jenkins-latest` image listed under your account

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Pull the Image from Another Machine
To test the uploaded image, try pulling it from another machine:
```sh
docker pull your-dockerhub-username/jenkins-latest:<tag>
```
Example:
```sh
docker pull vk62/jenkins-latest:v1
```

## üìå Notes
- Ensure Docker is installed on your system before performing these steps.
- If using **private repositories**, ensure your authentication is correct before pushing.
- Replace `your-dockerhub-username` with your actual Docker Hub username.
- Replace `<tag>` with an appropriate version number (e.g., `v1`, `latest`).


üöÄ Now your custom Jenkins Docker image is successfully pushed to Docker Hub and ready for use!
